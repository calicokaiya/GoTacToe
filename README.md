# GoTacToe
Ever wanted to play TicTacToe in your terminal? Me neither, but now you can.

# Dependencies
- `Go`

That's it.

# Build instructions
If you want to build, you just run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/calicokaiya/GoTacToe.git
cd GoTacToe
go build
```
Make sure that your Go environment is properly set if you have issues with this step. You can run your compiled app with the command `./tictactoe`. 

You can then move tictactoe to a folder in your $PATH if you want to be able to run it at any time in your terminal, from any folder, like a pro hacker tictactoe player.

It is also possible to run the application without building it like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/calicokaiya/GoTacToe.git
cd GoTacToe
go run main.go
```

# Contributing
If you want to submit a pull request to add or improve or improve documentation, feel free to do so in whatever way you feel most comfortable.

If you want to contribute with code, make sure to follow whatever standards I am already following. Make sure your code has plenty of comments, and that the point of your PR is made clear. I am currently not accepting new feature PRs, as I want to implement things myself to get more familiar with Go.

Feel free to suggest features.
